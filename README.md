# AiR
AiR is an attempt at making a tracker program for MS-DOS.

I added text file support which means you don't need to compile from source to make the music...... except for the fact that the file name can only be song.txt.
The notes have to be enclosed with an American dollar sign and the note length has to be enclosed with an ampersand. I tried to make it as simple as possible.
It could also be that I suck at reading.
The GUI wasn't what I wanted it to be, but it works and that's all I care about.
You can control the note selection with the arrow keys. L/R arrow keys for changing the semitone, U/D arrows keys for going to the next note in the track, tab for going to the length tab, U/D arrow keys in length to change note length by 500.
The application has scrolling so you don't have to worry about losing your notes. (Trust me I lost a lot of progress.)
Each song is still saved to song.txt.
There's also loading song.txt which means that you can share songs with your "friends."

# Compilation
### DJGPP
It should compile fine with the latest DJGPP version.
### Hi-Tech Pacific C
Theres probably some stuff you've gotta change to make it work in PPD, but that's about it.
