# AiR
AiR is a really terrible attempt at making a tracker program for MS-DOS, but I suck at using the computer so I gave up on the project.

It was meant to have a really simple GUI and simple keybinds to make it so you didn't have to learn the program before making music in it.
AiR uses the PC Speaker to make tones. (THATS IT)

The first version is just the C Major scale, but the next version adds rest notes..... I also programmed some notes of Risen by Terry A Davis.

# Compilation
### DJGPP
It should compile fine with the latest DJGPP version. I've only compiled it on Linux so I don't know if it'll compile on Windows.
### Hi-Tech Pacific C
Theres probably some stuff you've gotta change to make it work in PPD, but that's about it.
