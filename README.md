# AiR
AiR is a tracking program for MS-DOS 6.22 that uses the PC Speaker to make music.

The goal is to make creating tracker music easy and hassle free, including removing many features, having simple note selecting, and making it small.

# Compilation
### DJGPP
It should compile fine with the latest DJGPP version. I've only compiled it on Linux so I don't know if it'll compile on Windows.
### Hi-Tech Pacific C
Theres probably some stuff you've gotta change to make it work in PPD, but that's about it.
